-- Slime Transformation --
by GabeHasWon
commissioned by vagrantenchanter

This mod adds in a very simple Slime transformation, which turns the player into a Slime.
The transformations (which are treated as mounts) can be crafted with at least 100 gel at a bottle.

The Slime jumps higher by default, and inherits the player's movement and flight abilities (wings, double jump, run speed).
The Slime also has a couple minor touches that make it feel that much more like you're a Slime!

For those who seek a truly authentic slime experience, the Slime-Like Movement configuration option makes the Slime only move in air.
This config option also disables flight.
